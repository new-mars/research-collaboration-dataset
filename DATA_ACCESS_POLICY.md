# Data Access and Privacy Policy

## Repository Access Levels

### ðŸ“‚ Public Files (Open Access)
- `README.md` - Dataset documentation
- `supplementary_materials_highlighted.csv` - Representative sample (Table 4 quotes)
- `Dataset for Rethinking Research Collabor.md` - Dataset description
- `LICENSE` - Usage terms

### ðŸ”’ Protected Files (Technical Masking + Contact Required)  
- `supplementary_materials_971rows.csv` - Complete dataset structure (971 records) with **quotes technically redacted**

## Technical Protection Measures

### Quote Content Masking
The complete dataset file uses technical protection where:
- **Sensitive quotes are replaced** with masked identifiers: `[REDACTED_QUOTE_xxxxxxxx]`
- **Metadata preserved**: Word count and character count for each quote
- **Structure intact**: All categorical data, participant IDs, and themes remain visible
- **Hash-based consistency**: Same quote always gets the same masked identifier

This approach provides:
- âœ… **Technical protection** against misuse of sensitive content
- âœ… **Research transparency** through visible data structure and statistics
- âœ… **Replication capability** for qualified researchers with unmasked data

## Accessing the Complete Unmasked Dataset

### For Researchers
The complete **unmasked** dataset with original quote content (`supplementary_materials_971rows_FULL.csv`) is available to qualified researchers who:

1. **Contact the authors** at luoqiuxue86@bsuc.edu.cn
2. **Provide research credentials** (institutional affiliation, research purpose)
3. **Agree to data sharing terms** (ethical use, proper citation)
4. **Obtain institutional ethics approval** (if required by your institution)

### Usage Guidelines
- **Academic Research**: Primary purpose for accessing complete data
- **Proper Citation**: Must cite the original research paper
- **Data Security**: Implement appropriate data protection measures
- **No Redistribution**: Do not share the complete dataset without permission

### Contact Information
- **Email**: luoqiuxue86@bsuc.edu.cn
- **Subject**: "Research Collaboration Dataset Access Request"
- **Include**: 
  - Your name and institutional affiliation
  - Research project description
  - Intended use of the data
  - Timeline for research

## Technical Implementation Note
While the complete dataset file is present in this repository for transparency and accessibility to authorized researchers, we rely on professional ethics and this access policy to ensure appropriate usage. The file serves as a resource for the research community while maintaining responsible data sharing practices.

## Ethical Considerations
This approach balances:
- **Transparency**: Making research data available for verification
- **Privacy**: Protecting participant confidentiality through controlled access
- **Reproducibility**: Enabling replication studies by qualified researchers
- **Ethics**: Maintaining responsible research data sharing standards
